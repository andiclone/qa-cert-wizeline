# This project is an intro to TestCafe using NPM

You will need to have NPM and NodeJS installed in your computer to run this code.

## Getting Started

You will need to do an `npm install` before running the code.  

Once you have the dependencies installed, you can run the tests cases defined in the *package.json* e.g. `npm run test-all-chrome`

## Please note

You will also need to create a **.env** file in your root project dir with the variables used in Constants.js  
For example the env file could look like this:  
```
USERNAME=****
PASSWORD=****
INVALID_USERNAME=****
INVALID_PASSWORD=****
FISRT_NAME=****
LAST_NAME=****
ZIP_CODE=****
```

Just replace those values with the real ones that you can check on https://www.saucedemo.com/
